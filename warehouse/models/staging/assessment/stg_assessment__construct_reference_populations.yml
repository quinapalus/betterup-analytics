      This table is where our assessment science norms (means, SDs) are stored.
      This means that each reference_population has a record per construct.
      (There is also technically a record per reference_population_subgroup.)
      In that record, it stores the score_mean and score_sd for that reference_population x construct.
      This table can be thought of as the raw results of BetterUp psychometric research,
      how certain populations score against a number of behaviors/outcomes/characteristics (constructs).
