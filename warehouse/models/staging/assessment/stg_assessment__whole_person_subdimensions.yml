  - name: stg_assessment__whole_person_subdimensions
    description: DBT model stg_assessment__whole_person_subdimensions pulls in data
      from the raw table Stitch_Assessment.whole_person_subdimensions. It creates
      a primary key and renames fields related to subdimensions of the whole-person
      model, such as category, domain, and dimension. This data can be used to support
      analytic applications related to the whole-person model. [GenAI Description]

        tests:
          - unique
          - not_null

        description: The 'primary_key' column is a concatenation of the whole_person_model_version
          and key fields hashed as MD5. [GenAI Description]
      - name: whole_person_model_version
        description: This column stores the version of the Whole Person Model used

      - name: construct_id
        description: The construct_id column stores a unique identifier for each subdimension
          in the Whole Person model. [GenAI Description]

      - name: subdimension_key
        description: The 'subdimension_key' column refers to an identifier for the
          subdimension within a given model version of the whole person assessment.

      - name: name
        description: The 'name' column contains the name of the subdimension in the
          Whole Person Model. [GenAI Description]

          any spaces replaced by underscores. [GenAI Description]

      - name: dimension
        description: The 'dimension' column stores the higher level category of each
          assessment subdimension. [GenAI Description]

      - name: dimension_key
        description: The 'dimension_key' column stores a normalized version of the
          'dimension' column, with spaces replaced by underscores. [GenAI Description]
