  - name: stg_wkfw__construct_items
    description: The stg_wkfw__construct_items model provides a structured table of
      construct items sourced from the raw.stitch_app_viva_staging.construct_items
      table. It includes the fields construct_item_id, construct_id, is_scale_inverted,
      question_key, scale_length, created_at, and updated_at. Data stored in this
      model can be used to relate instructions for a given construct item task to
      its parent construct. [GenAI Description]
    columns:
      - name: construct_item_id
        description: The construct_item_id is an identifier for the construct item,
          storing information including the construct_id, is_scale_inverted, question_key,
          and scale_length. [GenAI Description]
        tests:
          - not_null
          - unique

      - name: construct_id
        description: The 'construct_id' column contains the unique identifier associated
          with the specific construct item. [GenAI Description]

      - name: is_scale_inverted
        description: The column 'is_scale_inverted' indicates whether the construct
          item's scale is inverted. [GenAI Description]

      - name: question_key
        description: The 'question_key' column stores unique identifiers for questions
          in the construct items table. [GenAI Description]

      - name: scale_length
        description: Scale_length is an integer which indicates the length of a scale
          used to measure responses in a construct item. [GenAI Description]

      - name: created_at
        description: created_at is a timestamp indicating when the construct item
          was created. [GenAI Description]

      - name: updated_at
        description: The 'updated_at' column contains a timestamp of when an item
          was most recently updated. [GenAI Description]
