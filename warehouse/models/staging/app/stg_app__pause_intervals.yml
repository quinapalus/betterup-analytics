  - name: stg_app__pause_intervals
    description: The DBT model stg_app__pause_intervals captures data about pause
      intervals for consumer subscription and product subscription assignments. It
      includes several fields such as pause interval ID, resume and pause scheduled
      job ID, paused until datetime, and status. Additionally, requested early unpause
      and paused at datetime columns are included to indicate how a pause started
      and when an unpause was requested. The model is sourced from raw.stitch_app.pause_intervals
      and provides a highly organized and structured output of the stored pause interval
      data. [GenAI Description]
