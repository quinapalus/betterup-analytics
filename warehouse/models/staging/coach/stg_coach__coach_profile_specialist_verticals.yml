      This is a join table between `app_coach_profiles` and `app_specialist_verticals`
      because each coach profile
      can be linked to multiple specialist verticals as of March 2020. If a specialist
      vertical is removed, the record
      will be destroyed from the table, so any historical reporting would be affected.
