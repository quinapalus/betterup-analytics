    description: >
      Fact table for Whole Person Model Subdimension Benchmark Scores by Industry and Employee
      Level. Data in this table is limited to WPM 2.0 currently, and only includes subdimensions
      from the conformed `dim_whole_person_subdimension` model. The grain of this fact table is
      one row per industry per role per subdimension. Benchmark scores in each row are designed
      to be aggregated to create composite benchmarks, e.g. Financial Services + Technology.

        description: >
          The mean scale score from our benchmarking sample for the given industry, employee
          level, and subdimension. Mean benchmark scale scores can be aggregated (averaged) to
          create composite benchmarks.
