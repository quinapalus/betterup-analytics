    description: The dei_d2c_first_subscription model provides a consolidated look
      into consumers' first subscription for a particular product. It tracks the initial
      subscription information (stripe_subscription_id, stripe_data, member_id, track_assignment_id,
      etc.) as well as product details associated with the subscription (consumer_product_price_unit_amount,
      consumer_product_price_recurring_interval, browser_name, etc.). The model focuses
      on the first customer subscription with this data, eliminating any duplicative
      information and making it easier to track consumer behavior. [GenAI Description]
