      - name: event_type
        description: >
          String denoting the type of event associated with the payment.
        tests:
          - not_null

      - name: augmented_event_type
        description: >
          String denoting the augmented type of event associated with the
          coach payment.
        tests:

      - name: is_coach_cost_manual_upload
        description: >
          String denoting whether the cost associated with the event type is a
          manual upload by the finance team.

      - name: deployment_type
        description: >
          String denoting the type of deployment associated with the payment.

      - name: event_at
        description: >
          Timestamp denoting when the event associated with the payment occurred.
        tests:
          - not_null

      - name: event_reported_at
        description: >
          Timestamp denoting when the event was reported by the finance team. Particularly,
          if the event was manually uploaded by the finance team, `sent_to_processor_at` reflects
          when the upload occurred, not when the actual event occurred (which is always in the prior month).
          For manual uploads, therefore, `event_reported_at` is always equal to `sent_to_processor_at` - 1 month.
          This is done to facilitate reporting on data in the `carina` layer.
        tests:
          - not_null

      - name: session_requested_length
        description: >

          `completed_sessions`.

          The length of the event reported in minutes. Should only be non-zero for
          session-related events (`completed_sessions`, `late_cancellation`, `late_reschedules`, `missed_session`).
        tests:
          - not_null

      - name: sent_to_processor_at
        description: >
          Timestamp denoting when the event was sent to Shortlist in UTC.
