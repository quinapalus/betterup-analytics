    description: >
      Internal warehouse helper model that contains a row for every user-global
      role pair. Global roles are roles in `app_roles` that are not scoped to a
      specific resource, e.g. `member`, `partner`, `coach`, etc. Global roles
      generally determine which features a user has access to when they are
      logged in to the platform.

      - name: user_id
