Named 'rigid' because it is not dynamic to track / reporting group filtering, like the one in Looker. That means this is the sequence across all tracks/reporting groups combined."

Named 'rigid' because it is not dynamic to track / reporting group filtering, like the one in Looker. That means this is the sequence across all tracks/reporting groups combined."
