  - name: dim_assessment_contributors
    description: The DBT model dim_assessment_contributors joins data from the int_app__assessments
      and stg_app__assessment_contributors models, creating fields for assessment_contributor_id,
      parent_assessment_id, role, contributor_id, response_assessment_id, created_at,
      response_created_at, response_submitted_at, report_generated_at, and also evaluating
      flags for whether the response has been submitted, the report has been generated,
      and whether the response was included in the report. [GenAI Description]
    columns:
      - name: assessment_contributor_id
        description: Primary key, unique for each requested contributor for the given
          parent assessment.
        tests:
          - unique
          - not_null

      - name: parent_assessment_id
        description: Foreign key to the (parent) self assessment for the given contributor.

      - name: role
        description: Role for the given contributor, e.g. manager, direct_report,
          other_coworker.

      - name: contributor_id
        description: Foreign key to user_id for the given contributor.

      - name: response_assessment_id
        description: Foreign key to the contributor's assessment. NULL if contributor
          has not yet started their response,

      - name: created_at
        description: Time when the contribution was requested.

      - name: response_created_at
        description: Time when the response assessment was started. Will be NULL if
          the contributor has not yet responded.

      - name: response_submitted_at
        description: Time when the response assessment was submitted. Will be NULL
          if contributor has not completed their response.

      - name: report_generated_at
        description: Time when the parent (member-facing) report was generated. Will
          be NULL for any 180 or 360 assessments pending completion. Generally, we
          expect response submitted time to occur prior to report generated time,
          however the application does not restrict contributors from submitting responses
          after the member report has already been generated. Note in these cases,
          the response assessment will *not* be included in the member's report.

      - name: is_report_generated
        description: Yes, if the member report has been generated.

      - name: is_response_included_in_report
        description: Yes, if the contributor's response in included in the member's
          report. Note responses submitted after the report has been generated are
          not included in the member's report.
