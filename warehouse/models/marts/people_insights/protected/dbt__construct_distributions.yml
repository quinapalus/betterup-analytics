      This intermediate model denormalizes the data in the following app staging tables:
      construct_reference_populations, constructs, reference_populations, and reference_population_subgroups.
      The base table is construct_reference_populations (science of psychometric score means, SDs by populations),
      then the other dimensional tables are joined to enrich the construct_reference_populations data with useful details.
