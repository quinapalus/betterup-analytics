    description: >
      This table tracks experiment, experiment_variant assignment events.  By creating
      this separate fact table, we remove the need to ingest all the other amplitude
      events into
      the fact_app_experiment_events table to accurately calculate the number of users
      assigned to experiments. 
    columns:
      - name: id
        description: Unique id for this table's granularity.
        tests:
          - unique
          - not_null

      - name: uuid
        description: Unique identifier for the event object. There should be many
          duplicates in this table.
        tests:
          - not_null
