    description: >
      Coach Assignments is the application table this is derived from.
      This is a rollup at the coach level, so all coach assignments aggregated by coach.
      It is also a daily snapshot, so a historic as_of_date is in the grain.
      Business context: Think of this int model as "assignments by coach"
      which is a factor of coach availability / the coach's ability to take new members
