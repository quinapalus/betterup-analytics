    description: >
      Timeslots is the application table this is derived from.
      This is a rollup at the coach level, so all timeslots aggregated by coach.
      It is also a daily snapshot, so a historic as_of_date is in the grain.
      This rollup is derived from another rollup:int_app__timeslots_coach_date_rollup_daily_snapshot
        (which is also rollup of timeslot data but per coach per *timeslot date* (and also a daily snapshot))
      Business context: Think of this int model as "upcoming coach timeslots in next 3, 7, 14 days"
      which is a factor of coach availability / the supply of coach hours
