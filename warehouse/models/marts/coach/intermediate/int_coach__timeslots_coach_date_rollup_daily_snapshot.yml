      Timeslots is the application table this is derived from.
      This is a rollup at the coach and timeslot date level, so all timeslots aggregated by coach and date.
      It is also a daily snapshot, so a historic as_of_date is in the grain.
      Business context: Think of this int model as "upcoming coach timeslots by date"
      which is a factor of coach availability / the supply of coach hours
